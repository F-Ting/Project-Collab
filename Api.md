## APIs
Currently, existing APIs are documented in the [API Wiki](https://github.com/csc302-spring-2019/proj-HackHub/wiki/API-WIKI)

We have also created API documentation for how our API will evolve to in the future. This documentation is created using the recommended swagger.io site. We've generated an yaml file.
