A  system like the above can be “sliced” into webapps and services in many different ways. (Until recently, before the rise of web services, many systems were one monolithic webapp.) 

In this course we are insisting you break the system up into at least two webapps and services: a instructor client webapp that creates, views, adds intervals and another webapp that student facing client code uses to edit meetings.  
## Web services (Confirm in OH tomorrow on 2+ web services)
- Furthermore, to follow the Bezos doctrine,  we insist that the webapps call into at least two web services
- What webservice have been created?

## Technologies (Tech Stack)
You have to decide which technology you will use to implement each webapp and endpoint. 
- Techologies used and why
