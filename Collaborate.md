# Communication

## Messaging

- We are using slack as our message board to organise meetings, quickly share and pin resources, and check in on one another. 
- In addition, the slack is also used for organising meeting times and share google hangouts links. 

## Progress

We are using GitHub issues to organise our story points, assign tasks and track our progress.

## Meetings

## Time/Location

- The large weekly meetings have no set time and location, but will usually take place on campus with the majority of the team  attending in person. 
- The time and location are decided near the beginning of the week by discussing on the group clack when everyone is free.
- Those who absolutely cannot make it in person will call in through a google hangouts link shared in the group slack.

## Shared documents

The google doc link to the meeting outline for us to look over the night before our weekly meeting for us to look over or add any topics we feel might be worth discussing during the meeting.

## Meeting Structure

### Minutes

Since the meeting outline is shared as a google doc link, everyone would help scribe the meeting minutes on the meeting outline. 

### Sprint Progress

For each person/pair, two things are discussed:

1. Are we on track to complete the tasks for the current sprint?

   - Are there any logistical or technical blockers preventing you from staying on track with the current sprint?
   - What kind of help do you need to keep up with the current sprint?

2. What are you going to do next week?

   - Do you have the capacity to take on new tasks for this week?

   - Do you have the capacity to help others with their tasks on top of staying on track with your own task?

### Product Owner

- How will you do regular standup meetings with your various conflicting schedules? Can online meetings help somehow?

# Workflow Processes

## Pair Programming

Given that not everyone in the team is familiar with the tech stack being used, the team decided that it would be most efficient if instead of assigning tasks to individual group members, we would use a system of pair programming. 

## Tasks

- Story points will be defined and assigned to pairs.
- Tasks will be created by then breaking down the story points.
- After the tasks have been approved by the scrum master, pairs will work together to complete the tasks.

## Sprints

- We will be using two week sprints. This works out quite nicely with the timeline we need to meet with the phase1 and phase2 deadlines. 
- For each sprint, each pair will try to complete the tasks created for the story they have been assigned to. 
- In between sprints, the scrum master will decide how to best reassign tasks to keep up with completing the sprint. 

## Scrum Master

- The scrum master is **Daniel**. 
- He will be responsible for organising meetings and decide how to best reassign tasks after reassessing the project mid sprint and at the end of a sprint. 

## TDD Person

- The TDD development person is **Daniel**.
- He is responsible for deciding which testing framework to use and setting up the appropriate infrastructure for the rest of us to model and use in our own development.

## CI Person

- The CI person is **Daniel**. 
- He is responsible for deciding which CI service we will use and setting up the appropriate infrastructure so that it easily integrates with our existing git workflow. 

## GitHub

- We will be using the feature branch work flow.
- Ideally we would like branch protection for master but for now it is an honour system.
- For each PR, we would like in addition to your partner doing a code review, one other member of the team who is not in your pair to do a code review. 

## Individual Roles

- George
- Matthew
- Anisha
- Kelly

### Scrum Master / TDD / CI Person

- Daniel

# Other



Create a strategy for how to divide work between individuals:

- Tasks 
- How will you size your tasks? (story points? hours?)
- Regular sprints? How many?
- Who’s the scrummaster?
- TDD person?
- CI person?
- How and where will you store your shared documents?
- github/git How will you collaborate? When will individuals be allowed to push individual commits themselves? When is a PR necessary?
- How will web client, endpoints, be divided across the team?
- Which roles will individuals take on?
- Repo man? (Inside joke. See http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087995/) 

Make sure to describe the team’s competencies and constraints.
Ex: Experience, strengths, skills, schedule conflicts and/or other relevant information about individual team members.
