# Communication

## Messaging

- We are using slack as our message board to organize meetings, quickly share and pin resources, and check in on one another.
- In addition, the slack is also used for organising meeting times and share google hangouts links.

## Progress

We are using GitHub issues to organise our story points, assign tasks and track our progress.

## Meetings

## Time/Location

- The large weekly meetings are generally scheduled to be Fridays during tutorial time, however schedule may change due to midterm conflicts, but will usually take place on campus with the majority of the team attending in person.
- The time and location are decided near the beginning of the week by discussing on the group slack when everyone is free.
- Those who absolutely cannot make it in person will call in through a google hangouts link shared in the group slack.

## Shared documents

The google doc link to the meeting outline for us to look over the night before our weekly meeting for us to look over or add any topics we feel might be worth discussing during the meeting.

## Meeting Structure

### Minutes

Since the meeting outline is shared as a google doc link, everyone would help scribe the meeting minutes on the meeting outline.

### Sprint Progress

For each person/pair, two things are discussed:

1. Are we on track to complete the tasks for the current sprint?

  - Are there any logistical or technical blockers preventing you from staying on track with the current sprint?
  - What kind of help do you need to keep up with the current sprint?

2. What are you going to do next week?

  - Do you have the capacity to take on new tasks for this week?

  - Do you have the capacity to help others with their tasks?

### Product Owner

- Weekly standup meeting are usually schedule to fit the majority of the group (more than 4 out of 7 members). The rest of the members will be provided meeting notes to support their understanding of the meeting. Furthermore, each member who aren't able to make it to the meeting will be scheduled a follow up 1 on 1 meeting to further explain their task in detail.
- In the case of weeks that meeting schedules are difficult to schedule, the product owner will list out tasks necessary to be done in the week, then contact each individual/pair to discuss and assign tasks. Given that we are doing pair programming as a team, it will be relatively easy to catch everyone up on the work needed to be done.

# Workflow Processes

## Pair Programming

Given that not everyone in the team is familiar with the tech stack being used, the team decided that it would be most efficient to do pair programming. 

## Tasks

- Story points will be defined and assigned to pairs.
- Tasks will be created by then breaking down the story points.
- After the tasks have been approved by the scrum master, pairs will work together to complete the tasks.

## Sprints

- We will be using two week sprints. This works out quite nicely with the timeline we need to meet with the phase1 and phase2 deadlines.
- For each sprint, each pair will try to complete the tasks created for the task they have been assigned to.
- In between sprints, the scrum master will decide how to best reassign tasks to keep up with completing the sprint.

## Scrum Master

- The scrum master is **Daniel**.
- He will be responsible for organizing meetings and decide how to best reassign tasks after reassessing the project mid sprint and at the end of a sprint.

## TDD Person

- The TDD development person is **Daniel**.
- He is responsible for deciding which testing framework to use and setting up the appropriate infrastructure for the rest of us to model and use in our own development.

## CI Person

- The CI person is **Daniel**.
- He is responsible for deciding which CI service we will use and setting up the appropriate infrastructure so that it easily integrates with our existing git workflow.

## GitHub

- We will be using the feature branch work flow.
- Ideally we would like branch protection for master but for now it is an honour system.
- For each PR, we would like in addition to your partner doing a code review, one other member of the team who is not in your pair to do a code review.
