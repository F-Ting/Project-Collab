## Communication
- Messaging: what will you use as a message board? Slack? HipChat? 
- How will you track your progress. Burndown chart? in story points?

## Meetings
Describe your meetings so far:
When, where (online, phone, physical location) of meetings
Who was there?
Rough meeting minutes/notes.
- When and where will you meet? 
- Agile/Scrum/Kanban?
- What was discusses?
- How did we track progress?

Shared documents:
- google doc? Github md? Links to google docs from markdowns?
- Team Wiki?
- Given your experience meeting so far.. consider the logistics of your future meetings

Who pretends to be the product owner?
- How will you do regular standup meetings with your various conflicting schedules? Can online meetings help somehow?

## Workflow processes

Create a strategy for how to divide work between individuals:

- How will you size your tasks? (story points? hours?)
- Regular sprints? How many?
- Who’s the scrummaster?
- TDD person?
- CI person?
- How and where will you store your shared documents?
- github/git How will you collaborate? When will individuals be allowed to push individual commits themselves? When is a PR necessary?
- How will web client, endpoints, be divided across the team?
- Which roles will individuals take on?
- Repo man? (Inside joke. See http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087995/) 


## Other 
Make sure to describe the team’s competencies and constraints.
